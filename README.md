# Boot-Strap-Project
This project was to solidify my understanding of the CSS framework BootStrap. I was able to use the bootstrap documentation to create this website that can be used as a template for any business needing a simple site made.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, BootStrap 5

The project was a very simple one as it only used HTML and BootStrap 5. Bootstrap 5 allowed for easy implementation of CSS styling by using only class names which allowed for the project to be done much faster while still providing responsive clean styles.



## Optimizations
Add the other pages to the site to make it complete. The modal signup sheet should have functionality to send to a database.



## Lessons Learned:

This Project allowed my bootstrap fundamentals to be solidifed. I learned that while bootstrap is a powerful tool for quick CSS styling it also does not allow for styling many things differently and can create sites that have the same styles used multiple times.
